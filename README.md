<h1>Human Activity Recognition Using Neural Networks</h1>

<h3>This is semester project I was given for my Machine learning class</h3>

The basic premise of this project is to perform classification on the UCI HAR dataset. The dataset has readings of multiple people taken from the sensor of a smartphone. The dataset has accelerometer and gyroscopic readings and the data is also divided into the time and frequency domain.

The dataset is already split into test and train and these two file are provided in the above rar file.

The ipynb file is heavily commented to make everyting easier to understand
